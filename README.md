# YOLOv3 on animal tracking

[ImageAI](https://imageai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) provided very powerful yet easy to use classes and functions to perform Video Object Detection and Tracking and Video analysis. ImageAI allows user to perform all of these with state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms like **RetinaNet**, **YOLOv3** and **TinyYOLOv3**. With ImageAI you can run detection tasks and analyse videos and live-video feeds from device cameras and IP cameras.
